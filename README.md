# IPP Internship

ALT-My code and files for my IPP Internship in the summer of 2018. 

## Primary Goals:
       	* Optimize STRAHL code to work with a more user friendly Python wrapper.
       	* Measure goodness of fit and speed of the followingin order to understand resolution of D and V profiles.
          * Least Squares (LSTSQ) regression
          * Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) regression
          * Gaussian Process (GP) regression
          * [Possibly] Combined MCMC GP regression 

## Optional Goals:
        * Understand how to use GitHub/BitBucket.
        * Optimize the workflow of fitting and usage of STRAHL.
        * Create good documentation and report of findings.
