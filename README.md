My code and files for my IPP Internship in the summer of 2018.

Primary Goals:
         - Optimize STRAHL code to work with a more user friendly Python wrapper.
         - Measure goodness of fit and speed of least squares regression, MCMC regression, 
         GP regression, and possible a combined MCMC GP regression in order to understand 
         resolution of D and V profiles.
         
Optional Goals:
          - Understand how to use GitHub/BitBucket.
          - Optimize the workflow of fitting and usage of STRAHL.
          - Create good documentation and report of findings.
