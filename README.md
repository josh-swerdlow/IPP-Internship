# IPP Internship Summer 2018
For the summer of 2018, I will be working at the Max Plank Institute for Plasma Physics also known as Institue for Plasma Physics (IPP). In this internship, I will be working with Professor Novimir Pablant (Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory) on an investigation on the resolution of *STRAHL* fitting capabilities. I will compare the Least Square (LSTSQ) regression algorithm and capabilities already implemented within STRAHL with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Gaussian Process (GP), and a combined MCMC-GP regression algorithm. While doing this research, I will also work closely with the STRAHL simulation software and look to design and optimized workflow. While doing all of this, I will maintain a BitBucket repository, working documentation of my code, and reports on my findings.

Goals

### Primary Goals:
* Rework STRAHL workflow to be faster and easier to use.
* Measure goodness of fit and speed of the following algorithms in order to understand resolution of D and V profiles.
    * Least Squares (LSTSQ) regression
    * Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) regression
    * Gaussian Process (GP) regression
    * [Possibly] Combined MCMC GP regression

### Seconday Goals:
* Understand how to use GitHub/BitBucket
* Create good documentation on code
* Maintain reports of findings

### Optional Goals [To be completed after Primary Goals?]:
* Do something with the data base
