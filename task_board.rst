Version History
---------------
v1.0.2
~~~~~~~~

v1.0.1
~~~~~~~~
^^ version number to help us track what has been updated in that version

- Create Demo [josw - 8/24/18] [josw - 8/24/18] [josw - 8/24/18]

- Implement Least Square Regression [novi - 5/20/18] [josw 6/1/18] [josw - 8/20/18]

^^ These completed tasks have been added under v1.0.1 because I have published this to the remote master branch.
If they weren't there then we can decide whether or not to release the updates we have done. Notice how
'Another completed task 1-7' is just left above? Well we can decide when things are ready to be released
since some tasks should be completed in groups. Perhaps when Another uncompleted task 8, 9, and 10 are
completed we would roll out a new update for v1.0.2!
